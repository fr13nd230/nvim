# 🌿 My Neovim Configuration

> _Because real devs don't use mouse clicks, they wield keystrokes like magic spells._

## ✨ Overview

Welcome to my **Neovim Configuration Repository** — a sacred space where Lua scripts, plugins, and keymaps unite in perfect chaotic harmony.  
This is where I tinker, break things, and occasionally achieve *editoric enlightenment*.

If you’ve ever thought,  
> “Maybe I should configure Neovim instead of actually coding,”  
then my friend, you are home. 🏡

## ⚙️ What’s Inside

- 🧠 **Smart keybindings** — because typing `:wq` every time is for the weak.  
- 🎨 **Pretty colors** — because your code deserves to *look fabulous*.  
- 🚀 **Plugin magic** — from fuzzy finders to AI copilots, everything your pinky finger could dream of.  
- 🦄 **Custom Lua madness** — where readability went to die, but performance thrives.

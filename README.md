# 🚀 My Neovim Config

> *"I don't always configure my editor, but when I do, I spend 47 hours on it instead of actually coding."*

## 📖 What is this?

Welcome to my Neovim configuration! This is where I keep all my carefully crafted settings that make me feel like a 10x developer (even though I'm probably more like a 1.2x developer on a good day).

## 🎯 Philosophy

This config follows the ancient philosophy of "copy stuff from the internet until it works, then never touch it again out of fear."

## 🙏 Shoutouts

Massive shoutouts to the legends who unknowingly became my unpaid consultants:

- **[ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen)** - For teaching me that hjkl is life and that the mouse is a lie
- **[Tony Banters](https://github.com/tonybanters)** - For making me realize my config could always be more complicated (in the best way)

If my config breaks, it's their fault. If it works, I'm a genius. 🧠

## ✨ Features

- ⚡ Fast (or at least it feels fast)
- 🎨 Pretty colors that make me feel productive
- 🔧 More plugins than I actually use
- 🤔 Keybindings I definitely won't forget (I will forget them)
- 🐛 Bugs that are actually features

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Back up your current config (or live dangerously)
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak

# Clone this bad boy
git clone https://github.com/fr13nd230/nvim ~/.config/nvim

# Open nvim and pray
nvim
```

## 🎮 Usage

1. Open Neovim
2. Press random keys until something happens
3. `:q!` when things go wrong
4. Repeat

## 🚧 Current Status

- [x] Finish configuring LSP
- [ ] Learn what half these plugins do
- [x] Actually write some code
- [x] Spend another weekend tweaking colors

## 📝 Notes

- If you see commented-out code, that's just archaeological evidence of my previous failed attempts
- Yes, I have 47 colorschemes installed
- No, I don't know what all the keybindings do
- Fight me about tabs vs spaces (spaces btw)

## 🤝 Contributing

Feel free to submit PRs, but I probably won't understand them and will merge them anyway.

## 📜 License

MIT - Because sharing is caring, and also because I copied most of this from other people anyway.

*Made with ❤️, coffee ☕, and an unhealthy amount of procrastination*

**Remember**: The best config is the one that makes you happy (or at least less sad).
